The third section (**Evidence**) contains citations and explanations for each problem. 
_________________________________________________________________________________________________

### Domains and Problems
1. Fashion & personal style 
    - **Context**: I find myself spending a lot of time discovering different outfits. My friends and I frequently cross reference many social media apps like Instagram, TikTok, and Pinterest to find new styles and trends.   
2. Healthcare processes **(Selected Domain 1)**
    - **Context**: I fell very ill last semester. As a result, I had to quickly familiarize myself with the entire process from filing out forms to getting a diagnosis to finding a specialist. 
        - **Problem 1 - Slow Pipeline**: The limited availability of doctors and the high amounts of coordination required by insurance providers, doctors' offices, amd the patients themselves, and more results in an *extremely* slow pipeline for scheduling appointments and getting any help.   
            - **Rejected**: This issue requires many groups of people to all be on board in order to resolve. If a single point in the pipeline does not cooperate, the pipeline will continue to be solve. However, the process of getting so many parties to be on-board drives attention away from the software creation process. 
        - **Problem 2 - Missing records**: For people constantly on the move, they may have health records in a variety of places and accounts. However, a complete and timely set of records is crucial for diagnosis.   
            - **Selected**: It is feasible to create a unified platform to improve the organization of medical records. This will help patients track dates, prescriptions, appointments, lab results, and more instead of managing piles of papers.   
        - **Problem 3 - Billing contentions**: There is very little transparency in healthcare regarding pricings of services, examinations, and lab works and how these charges are distributed to insurances and what the responsibilities of the patient are. This leads to confusing bills, overcharging, undercharging, and many disputes that take months to years to settle for patients. 
            - **Rejected**: Significant domain knowledge is needed to be able to resolve pricing transparency issues. Medical charges are complex and so are the insurance processes and legal perspective. I do not have this background, so coming up with a software-focused solution would be difficult.  
3. Online shopping
    - **Context**: Online shopping has grown tremendously in popularity over the years. Many retailers sell *similar* versions of a product. I always loose track and struggle with comparing these products exhaustively to find the best one for me  
4. Studying 
    - **Context**: Although there are a lot of apps and websites for studying (ex. Khan Academy), I think many lack the personalization aspect. Personalized systems for deep work, balancing study/work/life priorities, and long-term continuous learning are helpful to people at any stage in life that want to pick up new journeys. 
5. Language learning **(Selected Domain 2)**
    - **Context**: For the past months, I've been spending time learning Spanish. Learning a new language has so much potential to be made interesting beyond traditional learning methods like flashcards, worksheets, exercises etc.  
        - **Problem 1 - Routine methods**: Many language learners struggle with the traditional learning methods like flashcards, worksheets, exercises etc.    
            - **Selected**: I believe this problem can be solved with software elements! Developing and automating new learning techniques is common and strong purpose for software. I would be interested in combining unique learning strategies that worked for me from experience into a system, which is both technically and creatively challenging. 
        - **Problem 2 - Slow process**: Language learning is a slow process that can take months to years to get the basics and even longer to understand the cultural aspects.   
            - **Rejected**: Speeding up any learning process requires putting in more time or utilizing different learning techniques, so this may be solved simultaneously though problem 1, but directly creating software that speeds up learning is not exactly intuitive or straight forward to implement.  
        - **Problem 3 - Outdated**: Many phrases and vocabulary taught in older textbooks are outdated as languages are constantly evolving. 
            - **Rejected**: It requires significant market research and interviews per language to understand the current status of words, phrases, and how they are used in various contexts. They also change frequently. This takes significant time and draws emphasis away from software design. 
6. AI usage 
    - **Context**: Everyone uses AI for different tasks and in different ways. Some use it to draft essays, some use it to formulate emails, etc. After taking a psychology class, I've always been interested study the behaviors of people who use AI. Can we draw any conclusions from tracking this kind of data?
7. Financial literacy tools
    - **Context**: Because of my finance coursework and experience in valuation/derivatives, I see how intimidating investing can be for most people. In my opnion, current apps either oversimplify (hiding the mechanics) or overwhelm (too much jargon), and I actually found myself learning the most directly through short videos.  
8. Waiting in line **(Selected Domain 3)**
    - **Context**: I am always waiting in lines, whether it is to check out groceries or buy a concert ticket. This past summer, I lived in a major city for the first time ever and experienced the tedious process of lining up and waiting hours in the unbearable heat. In total, I waited in 7 lines for a range of reasons including brand pop-ups, sample sales, gifting events, restaurant grand opening, buying concert tickets, and more and got into 0 events. 
        - **Problem 1 - Physical discomfort**: Standing for long periods can cause fatigue or pain. Lack of seating, shade, heating, or cooling, and carrying heavy belongings with no place to set them down can significantly worsen one's experience.
            - **Rejected**: Physicial discomfort is a serious problem, but this is cannot be directly resolved with software solutions.   
        - **Problem 2 - Maximum uncertainty**: In these scenarios, there are many uncertain factors. You don't know if the commute to the destination is worth it, or how long you will be waiting for or if you will ever get to the end of the line before the event ends / produce sells out. 
            - **Selected**: The central problem here is lack of transparency. Venues / companies / events may not be willing to provide this information in order to maximize profits or exposure, but a simple software tracking system with user input can help with this issue. This is not a widespread issue, but I argue that it can help people save time and have potential to be expanded into other domains. Software can't directly alleviate pain (Problem 1), but can help users with decision making on whether a line is worth staying in.  
        - **Problem 3 - Massive Disruptions**: Massive lines of people that span many blocks cause disruptions for other people who live / work nearby and the neighboring businesses. 
            - **Rejected**: Forming and maintainting good neighbor relationships require geniune face-to-face communication, so the solution to this problem relies on human interaction dependent solutions.    
        
9. Misinformation & online trust 
    - **Context**: With the rise in AI content in social media, a lot of false information has also been dumped onto the internet, with certain demographics like young childen or old people more vunerable to believing false information or scams. I learned about the impacts of disinformation, deepfakes, AI-generated content and more through 6.4590 two semesters ago. 
10. Traveling  
    - **Context**: In my opinion, traveling is the best form of therapy, but the most difficult part is getting people together, balancing everyone's schedules and responsibilities.

### Stakeholders
- Problem: Missing records in healthcare processes  
    1. Stakeholder: *Patients* – “The Information Holders”
        - Patients are the ones whose health outcomes directly depend on accurate and complete records. Missing or scattered information can cause stress, delays in care, and even misdiagnosis. They are also the ones burdened with managing stacks of papers, patient portals, and communication across providers. From personal experience, each hospital / medical office uses a separate portal to store patient data. A solution would impact them directly by reducing confusion and streamlining care.
    2. Stakeholder: *Healthcare Providers* – “The Decision Makers”
        - Doctors, nurses, and specialists rely heavily on timely and accurate information to make diagnoses and treatment decisions. When records are incomplete, they risk redundant testing, delays, or prescribing treatments without full context. A unified record system would save them time, reduce errors, and enable better collaboration across providers.
    3. Stakeholder: *Insurers & Administrators* – “The System Gatekeepers”
        - Insurance companies and hospital administrators are responsible for approvals, billing, and compliance. Missing records can cause claim denials, billing disputes, or administrative bottlenecks. A centralized, organized record system could reduce costs tied to inefficiencies, minimize paperwork, and help ensure regulatory compliance.
    4. Stakeholder: *Epic Systems (MyChart)* - "The Existing System"
        - Epic is the largest Electronic Health Record (EHR) vendor and many hospitals use myChart, which is consistent with the idea of having a uniform system. Implementing a new system would interfere with the existing myChart system or other tools as competition.  
- Problem: Routine methods in language learning
    1. Stakeholder: *Learner* – “The Motivated Seekers”
        - Language learners are the core group affected. Many struggle with traditional methods like flashcards or worksheets because they may feel repetitive / disengaging. The impact is frustration, burnout, or giving up before reaching proficiency. A more creative, software-driven solution could make learning more interactive, personalized, and fun—helping learners stay motivated.  
    2. Stakeholder: *Language Learning Platforms & Developers* – “The Tool Builders”
        - Companies or independent developers that create apps, games, or digital resources for language learning are another key stakeholder. Outdated, traditional methods limit user engagement and retention. By adopting innovative strategies, they expand their reach, improve user satisfaction, and stand out in a crowded edtech market.  
    3. Stakeholder: *Educator* – “The Knowledge Guides”
        - Teachers, tutors, and course designers play a big role in how languages are taught. If learners find traditional tools ineffective, educators struggle to keep classes engaging or useful. New software-based approaches could empower them with better tools to blend formal instruction with interactive elements, making their teaching more effective.
- Problem: Maximum uncertainty in waiting in lines
    1. Stakeholder: *Attendees* – “The Time-Conscious Participants”
        - These are the individuals who actually stand in line for groceries, tickets, events, or sales. The problem of line uncertainty directly affects them as they waste hours commuting, standing in heat or cold, and often walk away empty-handed. A transparency-focused software solution would give them better decision-making power, helping them judge if the line is worth their time, and reducing frustration / lost opportunities.
    2. Stakeholder: *Event Organizers & Venues* – “The Experience Managers”
        - Organizers (brands, venues, stores, concert promoters) depend on lines to generate buzz and demand. However, poor line experiences can damage reputation if customers leave frustrated or share negative reviews. A solution that provides real-time transparency might make them nervous about losing attention, but could also help improve customer satisfaction, reduce overcrowding, and enhance brand trust in the long run.
    3. Stakeholder: *Competitor* – “The Alternative Destinations”
        - These are rival businesses or events competing for the same audience’s attention, time, and money. When long waits drive customers away, competitors can benefit by attracting those frustrated attendees with shorter lines or smoother entry processes. If a transparency system shows that a certain event’s line is unbearable, competitors could gain more foot traffic and sales.

### Evidence
- Problem: Missing records in healthcare processes  
    1. [Many](https://www.praxisemr.com/top-ehr-physicians-systems.html) electronic health record systems exist. Data transfer between systems takes much effort time and is tedious. Each has unique features for different needs, but results in inconsistency. 
    2. [Epic (MyChart)](https://isthmus.com/news/news/epic-dominates-the-marketplace/) current dominates online resource management in healthcare services. However, each hospital / medical center that uses MyChart requires a unique account. Accounts can be linked but there are many limitations.  
- Problem: Routine methods in language learning 
    1. [Language learning enrollment declines over the past 20 years and language teaching programs are feeling the impact.](https://multilingual.com/magazine/november-2024/the-decline-of-language-learning-in-us-higher-education/) This is caused by complex reasons and signifies that change is needed. 
    1. The [benefits](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5662126/) of learning multiple languages are highlighted in this research article. However, as learning methods fall behind, this results in missed opportunites for many.  
    1. [This blog](https://blog.thelinguist.com/duolingo-review/) highlights pros and cons of Duolingo, a well-established language learning platform from a user's perspective. A key limitation is the lack depth in the learning, which makes achieving fluency difficult for some.  
    2. [Another limitation](https://growingglobalcitizens.com/is-duolingo-effective-my-personal-review-as-a-language-teacher/) of Duolingo is the extreme gamification of language learning, which can easily skew the intention from learning to collecting points, gems, treasure chests and more. 
    3. Another popular platform is [Linq](https://linguistmag.com/lingq-review-2022/), but its limitations include that it only has a small selection of languages and the free version has limited features. 
    3. The blog highlights more [general limitations](https://www.lucalampariello.com/language-learning-apps/) of language learning apps, explaining boredom and burnout, screen distractions, and limited depth. 
    4. This article explains the concept of [language immersion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_immersion), a different method compared to gamification that is useful for language learning. 
    4. This [forum](https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/1lze50r/what_are_your_biggest_problems_with_language/) includes the opinions of many on why they struggle with using language apps. Some reflect that the emphasis is soley on vocabulary, and others mention various learning neads that are not met. 
    5. This research article used statistical methods to quantify a variety of measurements related to learning on language apps. One measurement was [student concerns](https://rsisinternational.org/journals/ijriss/articles/the-impacts-of-language-learning-apps-on-students-perceptions-of-language-proficiency/). Key concerns include lack of speaking practice, technical issues with the apps, and lack of motivation.
    10. This forum contains people's [open ended opinions](https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/12w7b6p/what_has_been_your_best_way_of_learning_a_new/) about the most effective learning strategies for them. Unlike the traditional games and strategies in apps, here we see many more diverse ideas from watching sports channels to children's cartoons. 
- Problem: Maximum uncertainty in waiting in lines
    1. This news report from today.com tries to understand the [phenomenon of long lines](https://www.today.com/video/inside-the-growing-phenomenon-of-long-lines-for-viral-sensations-238236229785) in cites. People's motives range from wanting to try a popular slice of pizza to buying a trending tote bag. The reasons are endless, demonstrating how many people experience long lines. 
    1. [Not all people hate a long line](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/comments/14tc0xg/what_long_lines_are_worth_waiting_for_in_nyc/). This forum gathers many opinions and some reflect that certain places are well worth the wait.  
    1. Pop ups are here to stay due to their [effectiveness as a marketing campaign](https://www.luxury-briefing.com/2019/08/pop-up-spaces-robert-soning/) to introduce new products, collaborate with other brands, on launch exclusive products. However, this also indicates that brands are less incentivized to resolve the problem of long lines since such events are such a success.  
    1. This forum collected people's experiences on the [longest wait times](https://www.reddit.com/r/rollercoasters/comments/1eztwej/other_what_is_the_longest_you_have_waited_in_line/) they endured at amusement parks and many shared that they had to wait hours, emphasizing how time consuming such events can be. 
    1. [How long are people willing to wait for?](https://www.glossy.co/pop/pop-up-culture-how-far-will-consumers-go-for-free/). Often times, the incentive you receive does not correlate with the long hours spent in line, but the immersive and personal experience of events repeatedly draws people who are willing to wait. 
    1. Aritzia, a popular Canadian clothing brand, allegedly experiences [lines over 1 km](https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/vancouver-aritzia-warehouse-sale-lineup-2025) for their annual warehouse event. This can quickly become an unpleasant experience and emphasizes importance in properly monitoring lines. 
    1. This article reports that many are [unsatisfied](https://cosmeticsbusiness.com/why-booming-beauty-pop-ups-are-letting-consumers-down) such experiences. Long lines result in high expectations that events frequently cannot meet, and therefore result in major letdowns. Attendees reported lack of communication and more crowd management. 
    1. This blog shares another key reason for [unpleasant lines](https://verticalledge.com/blogs/news/lessons-from-the-shadows-a-case-study-on-pop-up-failures?srsltid=AfmBOoptOyXARpsvlaiyaTTHX-bM6chyUKgGIs3M0YTtku5hX-yyvwBL): events often suffer from logistical issues, such as overcrowding, stock shortages, or inadequate staffing, can lead to a negative customer experience.
